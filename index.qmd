## Bio

I am a Research Data Scientist at the [American Institutes for Research (AIR)](https://www.air.org/). My research focuses on developing and applying quantitative methods to evaluate the effectiveness of education policies and interventions. I am particularly interested on college access issues affecting first-generation and historically marginalized students. My research draws from my personal experiences as a son of Mexican immigrants and a first-generation college student.

I earned my Ph.D. in Learning Sciences and Policy from the University of Pittsburgh, where I was a [National Academy of Education/Spencer Dissertation Fellow](https://naeducation.org/2021-naed-spencer-dissertation-fellows/). My work has been published in outlets such as the *Journal of Research on Educational Effectiveness*, *Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis*, *Inside Higher Ed*, and *Brookings.*
